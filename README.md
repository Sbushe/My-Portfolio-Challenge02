# My Portfolio

## Description

CSS Challenge 02: Portfolio

For this challenge I was tasked to create a professional portfolio that I will add to throughout the entirety of this course. I did so by using HTML & CSS, while keeping in mind the following requirements:

* Portfolio is divided into multiple sections that include, an About Me, My Work, & Contact Me.
* Portfolio includes functioning navigational links at the top of the page for each section.
* I also included a link to a Resume in the Nav bar.
* Portfolio includes a professional picture of myself.
* The About Me has been styled, but will be updated with a description throughout the course.
* The 'My Work' section has currently one sample project we have completed, & four placeholders for future projects.
* The Contact Me section has included my Email, Github link & my personal number.
* My portfolio was styled to operate on multiple screen sizes, including tablets or mobile devices.
* Hover effects have been added for various links and for the Projects on the page.
